# CardboardLog

## What's this?

A simple webapp to display the logs and some statistics for [CardboardBot](http://github.com/woll0r/cardboardbot).

## Requirements

- Python 2.7 (might work with Python 3, but untested)
- Bottle
- A CardboardBot database file

`pip install -r requirements.txt` should take care of installing Bottle for you.

## Remarks

I haven't tried running this standalone, I only run it through UWSGI. Might not
work when running standalone.
